# Varnish

* An HTTP accelerator that delivers a cached version of a page for a set amount of time without ever having to hit your back-end server, increasing the delivery of said page 300-1000x while reducing load on your server ten-fold. Each Varnish container can handle thousands of requests per second, much faster than a site's framework alone.

* The Drupal module allows for a user-friendly integration to Drupal requiring minimum system administration skills.

* Varnish can also improve the availability of your site. For example, if a PHP fatal error breaks your site, anonymous page requests can still be served by Varnish and end-users won't realize anything is wrong.
