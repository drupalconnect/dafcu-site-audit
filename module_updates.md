# Module Updates

There is no doubt that certain attention has been put towards module updates. A majority of modules are up-to-date and most of the remaining in need of updates are within one minor module version (see [Update Report](update_report.md)). Updating these modules (that aren't patched) should prove to be a smooth process. Any patches will need to be re-applied as needed (see [Patch Report](patches_report.md)).

Also, special diligence may be necessary when testing modules that are upgrading from a "dev" version to a release candidate or full release as the APIs may have changed (see below for list of modules).

* FlexSlider (flexslider) [7.x-2.0-alpha3+8-dev to 7.x-2.0-rc1]
* IP Geolocation Views & Maps (ip_geoloc) [7.x-1.25+86-dev to 7.x-1.28]
