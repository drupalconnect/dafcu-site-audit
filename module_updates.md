# Module Updates

There is no doubt that certain attention has been put towards module updates. A majority of modules are up-to-date and most of the remaining in need of updates are within one minor module version. Updating these modules (that aren't patched) should prove to be a smooth process. Special diligence may be necessary when testing modules that are upgrading from a "dev" version to a release candidate or full release as the APIs may have changed (see below).
