# Themes

There are multiple themes in use on this site, one for the parent site and for each subsite.  None of themes reference a base theme, which is recommended for code reuse.  All the subsite themes use HTML tables for page layout, which is highly discouraged.  There are multiple font folders in the yumca theme directory.  Template files have content in them that would be better suited for things like blocks (read: not translation friendly, breeches best practices).  Template files also contain some logic better suited for modules and some deprecated PHP functions.  The print.css file is dated (from Garland in Drupal 5), which suggests other components could also be dated.  The page.tpl.php specifies the use of Strict XHTML, but the site uses HTML markup that would not be well-formed.  The template.php file contains several things that should be in a module, like database calls and what should be theme functions.  It is also better to prefix functions with the theme name, not "phptemplate".  There are Views template files that are using the style tag, which is outside the head of the document, which should be avoided.  CSS should be put in dedicated files.
