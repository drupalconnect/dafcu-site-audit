Introduction
=======

The purpose of this audit is to identify areas in the Denali Alaskan Federal Credit Union site that can be improved upon. The audit focuses on, but is not limited to, performance and security.

A good place to start is the [Overview](overview.md) where we explain the process, then dig in to the [Actionable Recommendations](actionable_recommendations.md) to get our hands dirty. Lastly and probably least, you can find all of the nitty-gritty report data in the [Appendix](appendix.md).
