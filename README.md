Introduction
=======

The purpose of this audit is to identify areas in the Denali Alaskan Federal Credit Union site that can be improved upon. The audit focuses on, but is not limited to, performance and security.

A good place to start is the [Overview](overview.md) where the process will be explained. Next will be to dig in to the [Actionable Recommendations](actionable_recommendations.md) and get your hands dirty. There were some recommendations that were deemed not necessary at the time, you'll find those in the [Eventual Recommendations](down_the_road_recommendations.md) section. Lastly, one can find all of the nitty-gritty report data in the [Appendix](appendix.md).
