Introduction
=======

There is no doubt that the developers that have worked on this site know Drupal site building and development. Any site, of course, can be improved, and almost all custom modules have some rough edges or serve as a quick solution. With that, the point of this documentation is to identify the areas of the site that can be built and improved upon. This should help ease deeper understanding of the architecture of this Drupal instance.
