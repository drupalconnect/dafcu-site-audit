# Security Concerns

Security was not directly reviewed as a part of this general audit, but some items are identified in other sections of this document.

A full security audit should account for PCI compliance scans, review of custom code for best practices, ensuring that Drupal is up-to-date (core, modules, themes), reviewing any non-Drupal components (e.g. JS libs), and reviewing any patches.
