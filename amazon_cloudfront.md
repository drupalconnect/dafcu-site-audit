# Amazon CloudFront

Super Fast, yes, not only Cloudfront is very fast, it is the cheapest among all when you count the number of peer/pop servers they have. At the time of writing, they are still adding more servers. In short, it has twice the speed, and charge half the price. The only drawback is the lack of features. No way of stopping people from hot-linking your images.
