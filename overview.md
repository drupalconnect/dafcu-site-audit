# Overview

The public files for the site are in "sites/default/files" which is good, but there is a "sites/default/files.old" directory that may be taking up unnecessary disk space.

Drupal core for this site is a couple versions behind and requires an update to the latest version. The most recent release is 7.41 (which will change) and should be applied to maintain a secure site.

Out-of-date modules should also receive updates (see [Update Report](update_report.md)). Any patches will need to be re-applied as needed (see [Patches Report](patches_report.md).
